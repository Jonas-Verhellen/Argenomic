# Argenomic
Argenomic is  an open-source implementation of an illumination algorithm for optimization of small organic molecules.

### Installing

Download the source code from Github to your local machine and create the environment from the environment.yml file:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
Activate the new environment:
```
conda activate argenomic-stable
```
Verify that the new environment was installed correctly:
```
conda env list
```
